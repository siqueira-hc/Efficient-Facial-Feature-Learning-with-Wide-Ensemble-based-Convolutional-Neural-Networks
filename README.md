## On Development (Deadline: January 2020)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/siqueira-hc/Efficient-Facial-Feature-Learning-with-Wide-Ensemble-based-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
